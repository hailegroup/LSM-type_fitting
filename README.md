# LSM-type_fitting
A stripped down version of ECIF specifically for batch-fitting mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC) impedance spectra

The custom circuit applies for a symmetric electrode|MIEC|substrate|MIEC|electrode geometry, when electrode and MIEC electronic resistance is negligible, MIEC ionic resistance is non-negligible, and the substrate is electron-blocking. Two versions are included:
(1) CCfit: MIEC chemical capacitance is modeled by a pure capacitor
(2) CCfit_CPE: MIEC chemical capacitance is modeled by a constant phase element
